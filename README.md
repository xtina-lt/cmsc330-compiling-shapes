## What I Learned

I learned many invaluable lessons when creating this program. I am still getting use to a GUI, so this is interesting to me. Iâ€™m great with HTML and CSS, but not so much Java GUI things. I am growing to love it though. It is quite fun to see the different attributes and panels. I learned that the window is probably the frame and the sections of it are usually scenes. There is where the different objects live.

I learned quite a bit about how language translators and compilers work. Code starts as source code. It then goes to the Lexical Analyzer which can sometimes be called scanner. It results in a token stream. This token stream is then passed through a syntactic analyzer. A parse tree is created. In some languages there is an intermediate code generated which returns intermediate code. This then goes through a final code generator in some languages. Object code is the result.

Overall, I have a better appreciation of compilers.
